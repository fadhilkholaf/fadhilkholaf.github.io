        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Shiori is one of the few characters untouched, at first, by the
          cruelty surrounding her. She is reserved, observant, and almost
          impossibly pure—an echo of a world that still believes beauty can save
          something. Her stillness feels protective, but it’s also fragile. The
          boys drift between violence and escapism; Shiori tries to stay human
          in a place that rewards numbness.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 text-gray-300">
          Her connection to Yuichi is brief and awkward—two souls trying to
          reach each other through static. She doesn’t need to say much. The
          silence between them says everything.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center py-16">
          <p class="italic text-gray-400 text-lg">

          Why She Commits Suicide
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
          Fans read her death in many ways, but all of them circle one truth:
          the unbearable weight of awareness.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-4 mb-8">
          <li>
            <strong>A Rejection of the Contaminated World:</strong> She refuses
            to exist in a world where empathy is punished and cruelty thrives.
            Her suicide becomes an act of refusal—a quiet <em>no</em> to the
            entire social order that broke her.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Collapse of Innocence:</strong> The assault strips her
            not just of safety but of meaning. Shiori’s identity was built
            around quiet dignity; when that is violated, there’s nothing left to
            hold.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Union with Lily’s Ideal:</strong> Some fans see her death as
            a final merging with Lily’s ethereal presence. In the film, Lily is
            less a pop idol and more a ghost of purity. By dying, Shiori becomes
            part of that unreachable perfection—a tragic transcendence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text-center py-16">

            "Each reading is valid, and none offer comfort. The point isn’t to
            understand her act—it’s to feel the silence it leaves behind."

            In the end, Tsuda Shiori isn’t remembered for what she did, but for
            what she represented—a fragile resistance to numbness. Her death is
            not heroic, not poetic. It’s the final chord in a song that was
            always about loneliness.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-200 text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto">
            And as the last note fades, you understand that she didn’t die to
            escape life. She died because life, in that world, had already
            disappeared.
